This bundle is a modified version of the Lua bundle for TextMate which contains support for the [Love](http://love2d.org) 0.7.0 game engine. Features include:

* Highlighting for Love modules, classes, functions and enums.
* Look up phrase on the Love wiki. For example, highlight "love.physics" in TextMate, execute the command and you'll be taken to wiki page for the module in your browser.
* Search phrase(s) on the Love forums. Highlight the keywords you want to search in TextMate and execute the command.
* Run the game. If you're editing in a project, focus can be on any file, otherwise you must execute this on the main.lua or any other top level file. Shortcut is Command+R.
* Build a .love file. Same rules apply for file focus as running the game. This command will place a file called "game.love" in your project folder. Shortcut is Command+B.

I'm planning to add more in the future. Let me know what you think. Enjoy!
